                                            3P99 and 4F90. The intent of these courses is to help prepare you for
                                            future large scale projects; both in terms of workplace as well as those
                                            considering a Masters degree.</p>
                                        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                                        <p>These notes refer to the organization and evaluation of COSC 3P99 and
                                            4F90, being the half-credit and the full-credit project courses for
                                            individual students, correspondingly. One of the purposes of the project
                                            courses is to assess whether a senior student can work independently
                                            towards the delivery of a major piece of work. Each project is
                                            supervised by one faculty member (&#8216;the supervisor&#8217;) from the
                                            Department of Computer Science and requires the on-going production and
                                            submission of written work. It culminates in the submission of the final
                                            documents, with an oral presentation to the thesis examining committee,
                                            and interested students and staff (this is optional for 3P99 projects).
                                            Optionally, there may be a second, external supervisor from another
                                            department at Brock. Students taking or intending to take COSC 3P99 and
                                            4F90 courses are strongly encouraged to attend the departmental
                                            seminars. This will facilitate the selection of a proper career path in
                                            general, and of a suitable project topic in particular. In order to
                                            further their career goals, students are strongly encouraged to propose
                                            their own project topics in consultation with a potential supervisor.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Please refer to <strong>COSC 3P99 / 4F90 guidelines at this <a
                                                    href="https://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/computer-science/3p99_4f90_complete/"

                                        <p>Given that computing as a discipline owes much of its success to its
                                            multidisciplinary relevance, students are particularly encouraged to
                                            seek out the project topics of multidisciplinary nature. Alternatively,
                                            the project topic can be selected from the ongoing projects and research
                                            interests of faculty members of the Department of Computer Science
                                            (which also includes projects proposed from outside the Department).
                                            Most successful student projects arise from discussions between students
                                            and faculty. Please peruse this list of computer science faculty home
                                            pages to learn more about their research. You are encouraged to contact
                                            them to discuss possible project ideas.</p>

                                        <p>A student (and the supervisor) must complete a Topic Selection form and
                                            the Responsibilities form, obtainable from the Project Coordinator <a
                                                href="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~nezzatijivan/">Dr. Naser
                                                Ezzati-Jivan</a> (room
                                            J312) or at this <a
                                                href="https://naser.github.io/assets/3p99_4f90_complete.pdf"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>. These forms must
                                            be returned to the Coordinator after they are signed. Once these have
                                            been submitted then the student can register.</p>
                                        <h3>2.1. Student Project Proposal (Optional)</h3>
                                        <p><i>This is not a required step. A student can discuss with their 
                                            potential supervisor if they intend to submit one.</i></p>

                                        <p>A student wishing to undertake a project should normally seek a faculty
                                            member willing to act as a supervisor. Projects that are designed with
                                            the involvement of a computer science faculty member are automatically
                                            given approval status. Before the student proceeds with the project, the
                                            project should be written up in the proposal format below. This document
                                            will be put in the student&#8217;s file. Should the supervisor desire
                                            feedback on the proposed project, the proposal can be circulated among
                                            the department for comments.</p>
                                        <p>Occasionally, projects can be proposed and supervised by faculty or
                                            individuals outside of the Computer Science department. These projects
                                            should be written up as a proposal (see below) and circulated for
                                            department approval. A computer science faculty member must be willing
                                            to be a co-supervisor before the project can proceed.</p>
                                        <p>A student wishing to propose her/his own project, but has not yet found a
                                            supervisor, should write a brief (one to two pages) proposal. The
                                            proposal should be submitted to the Project Coordinator for approval by
                                            the department, which may take up to two weeks. If a student is unable
                                            to find a supervisor, the Chair should be contacted and they will try
                                            to find a faculty member or decide whether the project is feasible
                                            within our department.</p>
                                        
                                            <h3>2.2. Project Proposal Format</h3>
                                        <p>The format of the project proposal, to be submitted by e-mail, is as

                                            to evaluate the proposal on both academic merit and 
                                            the amount of work required.

                                        <p>In the case of a student selecting a project from the list of available
                                            projects, there is no need for a project proposal- the student must
                                            contact the project supervisor and get his/her approval. If this person
                                            cannot be contacted for whatever reason the Project Coordinator should
                                            be approached.</p>
                                        <h2>3. Registration</h2>
                                        <p>A student must have a project selected prior to registration in the
                                            course and supervisor. The student must ensure that they have submitted
                                            the signed override to the Project Coordinator before registration.</p>
                                        <h3>3.1. Withdrawal</h3>
                                        <p>Students may withdraw from the course by the date specified in the
                                            University Calendar without academic penalty &#8211; please check the
                                            University Calendar for exact dates. A student will normally not be
                                            allowed to select the same project at a subsequent registration.</p>
                                        <h3>3.2. Challenge for Credit</h3>
                                        <p>The course may be &#8216;challenged for credit&#8217;. This challenge is
                                            designed to provide credit at the undergraduate level for skills
                                            acquired through learning and experience outside the University (see the
                                            University Calendar). If challenged, the Department will consider, among
                                            other things, the following:</p>
                                        <p>the project was completed by the challenger while they were employed;
                                            and<br />
                                            a satisfactory report is received from the challenger&#8217;s immediate
                                            manager or supervisor regarding the original proposal, stating who was
                                            responsible for the work.</p>
                                        <p>The project will still have to be presented orally and be supported by
                                            appropriate reports. All software (including source code) must also be
                                            made available to the Department.</p>
                                        <h3>3.3. Independent Work</h3>
                                        <p>If a student has started a piece of work independently, then they
                                            should have the project approved through the normal channels (as if the
                                            work had not yet been started) and register as normal for the course.
                                            There is no onus on the faculty to approve such a project, and in fact,
                                            additional work may be suggested. This is not the recommended route.</p>
                                        <h2>4. Responsibilities</h2>
                                        <h3>4.1. Student</h3>
                                        <p>The student assumes the responsibility for the research, design,
                                            implementation and documentation of his/her project. It is the
                                            responsibility of the student to arrange, in consultation with his/her
                                            supervisor, a suitable schedule of meetings, with the understanding that
                                            these will be met, except in extenuating circumstances, such as
                                            sickness. It is the responsibility of the student to be thoroughly
                                            familiar with the project guidelines and to ensure that the various
                                            deadlines are met.</p>
                                        <h3>4.2. Supervisor</h3>
                                        <p>The project supervisor acts as a consultant on such matters as the
                                            structure of the reports, and the department&#8217;s expectations on
                                            content. In addition, supervisors help students locate reference
                                            material, work out system specifications and solve technical problems
                                            related to the project. It is the supervisor&#8217;s responsibility to
                                            make time available, within reason, when the student requests a meeting.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>4.3. Supervisor/Student</h3>
                                        <p>Before setting out on the project, the student and/or supervisor must
                                            make sure that the necessary hardware/software is available and ready to
                                            use. Requests for the installation of new equipment should be discussed
                                            with the Chair prior to the project assignment.</p>
                                        <h4>4.4. Forms to be Signed</h4>
                                        <p>The Project Responsibilities form and the Topic Selection form (obtained
                                            from Departmental Secretary, Room J314) must be completed and signed by
                                            both the student and the supervisor.</p>
                                        <h2>5. Examination</h2>
                                        <p>COSC 3P99 projects will be marked by the supervisor. At the discretion of
                                            the supervisor, a final oral presentation may be scheduled.</p>
                                        <p>For COSC 4F90 projects an examining committee (consisting of the
                                            supervisor and a member of the Department&#8217;s faculty) will be
                                            formed, at the start of the project, by the Project Coordinator,
                                            typically based on the areas of interest of faculty and an equitable
                                            workload. The examining committee will be present for the final oral
                                            presentation. After the presentation, the examination committee will
                                            meet in camera in order to arrive at the overall project mark, following
                                            the standard evaluation criteria.</p>
                                        <h2>6. Department website</h2>
                                        <p>At the discretion of both the student and supervisor, the final results
                                            of a project may be placed on the department&#8217;s website. This can
                                            be a useful way to advertise and promote the student&#8217;s
                                            accomplishments, possibly for future employment.</p>
